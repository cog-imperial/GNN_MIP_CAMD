## Data preparation

Two datasets (QM7 and QM9) used in this paper are avaiable in package [*chemprop*](https://chemprop.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html#data) (available under a MIT license in ``\data\LICENSE.txt``). We already download and uncompress them here. 

Since we are incorporating part of *chemprop*, this folder includes the *chemprop* license.
